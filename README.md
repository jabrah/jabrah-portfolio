I wanted to create a relatively simple portfolio site that would also let me learn some interesting technology. This seemed like a good excuse to try out NextJS in a small scale project. Because I chose to deploy to GitHub pages for simplicity, the project is exported to static HTML, which limits number of features available in the NextJS framework. Since this is intended as a small scale learning project with a simple deliverable, I felt that the trade-off was fair.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Tech used

* NextJS (also implying the use of React)
* TailwindCSS
* Yarn

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
